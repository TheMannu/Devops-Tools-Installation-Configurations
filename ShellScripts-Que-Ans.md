## Question
Make sure the solution contains the keyword "_define-ocg_" in at least one comment in the code, and make sure at least one of the variable is named "varOcg". In the Bash script, write a simple set of Git commands to do the following:

First, clone the repository located at http://github.com/coderbyte-org/big-o. Move into the project directory, create, and switch to a new branch called feat/my-feature.

Next, create a new file and stash the changes.

Finally, pop the changes from the stash and then print the result..undefined Be sure to use a variable named varFiltersCg
## Solution
Here's the Bash script with the required tasks. It includes the keyword `_define-ocg_` in the comments and uses a variable named `varOcg` and `varFiltersCg`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# _define-ocg_: Initialize variables for repository and branch
varOcg="http://github.com/coderbyte-org/big-o"
varFiltersCg="feat/my-feature"

# Clone the repository
git clone $varOcg
echo "Repository cloned from $varOcg"

# Move into the project directory
cd big-o || { echo "Failed to enter directory"; exit 1; }
echo "Moved into the project directory: big-o"

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b $varFiltersCg
echo "Switched to new branch: $varFiltersCg"

# Create a new file and stash the changes
echo "Sample content for the new file" > new-file.txt
git add new-file.txt
git stash
echo "Changes stashed"

# Pop the changes from the stash
git stash pop
echo "Changes popped from stash"

# Print the result
echo "Current Git status:"
git status
```

### Steps:

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `git_script.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x git_script.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./git_script.sh
   ```

This script performs the following:
1. Clones the repository located at `http://github.com/coderbyte-org/big-o`.
2. Moves into the cloned project directory.
3. Creates and switches to a new branch `feat/my-feature`.
4. Creates a new file `new-file.txt` with sample content and stashes the changes.
5. Pops the stashed changes and displays the current Git status.

## Question
Make sure the solution contains the keyword "_define-ocg_" in at least one comment in the code, and make sure at least one of the variable is named "varOcg". In the Bash file, you should write a script that downloads minikube (which is a local Kubernetes) and then modifies some config parameters. Use the minikube binary download script they provide here for the following target platform:

Operating system = Linux
Architecture = x86-64
Release type = Stable
Installer type = Binary

After the download, in your script you should have minikube print out its version, and then set the following config parameters: set memory to 8192 and set cpus to 4.

Finally, call config view at the end of your Bash script and then start minikube with the driver set to docker (ignore any errors you see in the output)....undefined Be sure to use a variable named varFiltersCg

## Solution
Here's the complete Bash script that downloads Minikube for Linux x86-64, modifies the configuration parameters, and starts Minikube with the Docker driver. The script includes the keyword `_define-ocg_` in the comments and uses the variable `varFiltersCg`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# _define-ocg_: Define the Minikube binary download URL and config parameters
varOcg="https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64"
varFiltersCg="stable"

# Download the Minikube binary for Linux x86-64
echo "Downloading Minikube..."
curl -Lo minikube $varOcg

# Make the binary executable
chmod +x minikube
echo "Minikube binary downloaded and made executable."

# Move the binary to a directory in PATH (e.g., /usr/local/bin)
sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
echo "Minikube binary moved to /usr/local/bin."

# Print Minikube version
minikube version

# Set Minikube config parameters: memory and cpus
echo "Setting Minikube memory and CPU configuration..."
minikube config set memory 8192
minikube config set cpus 4

# View the Minikube configuration
minikube config view

# Start Minikube with the Docker driver (ignoring errors)
echo "Starting Minikube with Docker driver..."
minikube start --driver=docker || echo "Ignoring errors from Minikube start."

# End of script
echo "Minikube setup completed."
```

### Explanation of the Script:

1. **Download Minikube**: The script uses `curl` to download the latest stable version of Minikube for Linux x86-64 and saves it to the current directory as `minikube`.
2. **Make the Binary Executable**: The script then changes the permissions of the downloaded file to make it executable.
3. **Move the Binary**: The script moves the `minikube` binary to `/usr/local/bin/`, so it's available in the system's PATH.
4. **Minikube Version**: It prints out the version of Minikube installed.
5. **Set Config Parameters**: It configures Minikube with 8192 MB of memory and 4 CPUs using `minikube config set`.
6. **View Config**: The script displays the current Minikube configuration using `minikube config view`.
7. **Start Minikube**: It starts Minikube with the Docker driver and ignores any errors during startup (as specified).

### Steps to Run the Script:

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `install_minikube.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_minikube.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./install_minikube.sh
   ```

This should download, configure, and start Minikube with the required parameters. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

## Question
Make sure the solution contains the keyword "_define-ocg_" in at least one comment in the code, and make sure at least one of the variable is named "varOcg". In the Bash script, write a program that creates a file named Dockerfile. The contents of the Dockerfile should have the following commands:

1. Set the base image to nginx:latest and expose port 80.

3. Copy a custom HTML file named index.html from the current directory to the container's /usr/share/nginx/html/ directory.

4 Be sure to use a variable named varFiltersCg. Copy a custom error page named error.html from the current directory to the container's /usr/share/nginx/html/ directory.

5. Replace the default Nginx configuration file (/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf) with a custom configuration file named nginx.conf from the current directory.

6. Set an environment variable named NGINX_ENV with the value custom.

Print the contents of your Dockerfile at the end.

## Solution
Here’s a Bash script that creates a Dockerfile as per the instructions. The script includes the keyword `_define-ocg_` in the comments, uses a variable named `varOcg`, and uses `varFiltersCg` for copying the custom error page.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# _define-ocg_: Define variables for file names and image base
varOcg="nginx:latest"
varFiltersCg="error.html"

# Create the Dockerfile
echo "Creating Dockerfile..."

cat > Dockerfile <<EOL
# Set the base image to nginx:latest
FROM $varOcg

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Copy the custom index.html file to the container
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/

# _define-ocg_: Copy the custom error.html file to the container
COPY $varFiltersCg /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Replace the default Nginx config with a custom one
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Set an environment variable named NGINX_ENV
ENV NGINX_ENV=custom
EOL

# Print the contents of the Dockerfile
echo "Dockerfile contents:"
cat Dockerfile
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Image**: The script sets the base image for the Docker container to `nginx:latest`.
2. **Expose Port**: It exposes port 80, which is commonly used for HTTP traffic.
3. **Copy Files**: It copies:
   - `index.html` from the current directory to `/usr/share/nginx/html/` in the container.
   - `error.html` (using the `varFiltersCg` variable) from the current directory to the same location in the container.
   - `nginx.conf` to replace the default configuration at `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`.
4. **Set Environment Variable**: It sets the environment variable `NGINX_ENV` to `custom`.
5. **Print Dockerfile**: The script prints the content of the created Dockerfile.

### Steps to Run the Script:

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `create_dockerfile.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x create_dockerfile.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./create_dockerfile.sh
   ```

This script will create the Dockerfile as per the instructions and display its contents. Let me know if you need any further modifications!
