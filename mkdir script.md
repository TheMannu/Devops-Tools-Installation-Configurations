The command `mkdir %time:~0,2%.%time :~3,2%` is a Windows batch script command that creates a directory with a name based on the current time. Here's a breakdown:

- `%time%`: Represents the current system time in the format `HH:MM:SS.milliseconds`.
- `%time:~0,2%`: Extracts the hour part from the current time.
- `%time:~3,2%`: Extracts the minute part from the current time.

The overall result of the command creates a folder named with the current hour and minute, separated by a dot. For example, if the time is `14:25`, it will create a directory named `14.25`.

This is useful for timestamped directory creation in scripts.
