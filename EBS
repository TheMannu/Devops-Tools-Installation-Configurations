EBS - Elastic Block Storage
1) We can create an EBS in  SAN (Storage Area Network) and can be mounted on our machine using network that can be further used by the machine as storage
2) In Windows EBS is C drive and in Linux it is known as Root Volume
3) The OS is installed on root volume (EBS) that is attached to ec2 using SAN
4) Read write operations on ebs do faces latency but is highly negligible.
5) One comupte machine or ec2 can have multiple EBS volumes attached to it and even if the machine goes down the volume will keep the data stored as persistent storage 

6) Specific types of EBS (Io2 and Io1) can be attached with multiple EC2 instances 
7) EBS and EC2 instance should be in same AZs then only it can be attached
8) Size of EBS can be increased without stopping the instance but can not be decreased as downgrading in not allowed 
9) We can move EBS from one AZ to another AZ by taking backup as Snapshot

10) Instance can be created with root as instance store in this case data gets deleted even if the instance is stoped or restarted 
11) So Instance Store as EBS when data is needed to be temporary but the fastest read write operations and further not required 
12) Whenever we create an EBS volume the AWS by default creates a replica and if any thing happens to the EBS the it automatically connects to the replica ebs

13) For adding an EBS to the Instance We need to Create an EBS volume in same AZ and then select -Click Actions - Attach volume - 
check with 
- lsblk                                               -> to check all the block storages 
- sudo mkfs.ext4  /dev/xvdf             -> to format the EBS storage
- or - sudo !!                                       ->  !! is to run the above command
- sudo mkdir /test                             -> to create a folder that will be attached with ebs volume 
- sudo mount  /dev/xvdf  /test/         -> to mount the volume to the test folder
- mountpoint  /test                            -> to chech if it has been mounted
