EBS - Elastic Block Storage
1) We can create an EBS in  SAN (Storage Area Network) and can be mounted on our machine using network that can be further used by the machine as storage
2) In Windows EBS is C drive and in Linux it is known as Root Volume
3) The OS is installed on root volume (EBS) that is attached to ec2 using SAN
4) Read write operations on ebs do faces latency but is highly negligible.
5) One comupte machine or ec2 can have multiple EBS volumes attached to it and even if the machine goes down the volume will keep the data stored as persistent storage
